# NIST-Cybersecurity-Assessment-Practice

---

## Objective
The goal of this project was to perform a comprehensive NIST cybersecurity assessment of Oscorp, a fictional enterprise, to evaluate its current cybersecurity posture. This involved assessing various security controls across multiple domains and providing recommendations for improvement. The project followed NIST guidelines to ensure a robust cybersecurity framework, addressing vulnerabilities and implementing best practices. This was a capstone project for the GRC Mastery Certification.
